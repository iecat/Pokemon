# Pokemon

# How to run it
1. Clone repository (master branch)
2. Open the solution in IDE (eg. Visual Studio) 
3. Restore Nuget Packages
4. Run solution

# To be consider
Due to the lack of time there are few minor things outstanding

1. Please make sure you clone the master branch. There is a main branch default (as I tried to be quick on commiting I didn't realize I already create the repository with main, 
and being used to work with master as default branch in my day to day work, I wrote master when I pushed the changes from command ( :facepalm) )
2. Please note I didn't cover the entire code in unit tests. For the sake of showing off my testing skills I just added few integration test and unit test - the rest of the code can be tested on the same fashon - and is very trivial
3. Please not I had to install a minor version of Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing. The latest one require uphgrade to .net core on my PC - 
4. I could have extracted the classes in PokemonJson in separate classes ( this is subjective and depends on dev prefference )
5. I could have added some logging, due to the fact there is ILogger avaialable
